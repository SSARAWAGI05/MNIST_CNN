## Description of the Code

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The code is structured to facilitate data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

### Data Loading

The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras, which splits the data into training and testing sets. The training set consists of 60,000 images, while the testing set contains 10,000 images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing a handwritten digit.

### Data Visualization

The first image from the training set is displayed using Matplotlib to provide a visual understanding of the data being processed.

### Data Preprocessing

The training and testing images are reshaped to include a channel dimension, converting the data from a shape of (60000, 28, 28) to (60000, 28, 28, 1). This format is necessary for the CNN to correctly interpret the input.

The pixel values of the images, which originally range from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255. This normalization helps the model train more effectively.

### Data Augmentation

To improve the model's generalization capabilities, a sequential data augmentation layer is applied. This layer includes random transformations such as rotation, zoom, and translation, which create variations of the training images and help prevent overfitting.

### Model Architecture

A sequential CNN is constructed, which includes the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Specifies the input shape of the images.
2. **Data Augmentation Layer**: Applies the random transformations to the input images.
3. **Convolutional Layers**: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions for feature extraction.
4. **Max Pooling Layers**: Two max pooling layers to downsample the feature maps.
5. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 3D output of the convolutional layers into a 1D vector.
6. **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer with ReLU activation for further processing.
7. **Dropout Layer**: A dropout layer to reduce overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training.
8. **Output Layer**: A dense layer with softmax activation to produce class probabilities for the digits 0-9.

### Model Compilation

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function. Accuracy is set as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training and validation.

### Model Training

The model is trained using the preprocessed training data for 15 epochs, with a batch size of 128. A validation split of 20% of the training data is used to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.

### Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using the test dataset. The evaluation returns the test loss and test accuracy, allowing an assessment of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
